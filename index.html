                            Jobs is widely recognized as a pioneer of the microcomputer revolution of the 1970s, along with Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak. Jobs also helped to popularize the personal computer with the introduction of the Apple II, one of the first highly successful mass-produced microcomputers.

                        <p class="bio-paragraph">
                            In the late 1970s, Jobs, along with Apple's marketing chief Mike Markkula and fellow Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak, designed, developed, and marketed one of the first commercially successful lines of personal computers, the Apple II series.
